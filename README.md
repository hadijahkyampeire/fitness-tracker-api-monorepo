# FitTrack â€“ Fitness Microservices System

FitTrack is a distributed fitness tracking application designed using microservices architecture. It allows users to register, manage profiles, choose workout plans, and track progress on various workout categories and levels. 

The system has 3 roles, ADMIN, COACH and USER.
- ADMIN has access to all endpoints and is the only one to CRUD workout categories.
- COACH is able to create an account, create workouts based on the system's categories.
- USER is able to create an account, select their preferred workout categories and workout plans associated with the categories.
